# webpack-by-mustak

just download or clone it 
and then you need to change some code if you see any error .

1. go to webpack.config.js file and change port number whatever you want , port will be 4 digit (remember when you faced any error then change it)
2. go to you terminal and type rm -r .git
3. type this command on your termial => npm install <=
wait for installation
4. and then type => npm start 

it will be open on your browser automatically 

thanks
